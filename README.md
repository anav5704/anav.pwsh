# anav.pwsh

These are my Windows PowerShell config files. `gruvbox.omp.json` is the Gruvbox theme for Oh My Posh and `gruvbox.pwsh.json` is the Gruvbox theme for the terminal app itself. The `pwsh_profile.ps1` file contains aliases to the CLI tools I commonly use.

## Getting Started

Requirements: Oh My Posh.

Enter the follwing command into your terminal. It will open a file using the notepad application:

```bash
notepad $PROFILE
```

Paste the contents from `pwsh_profile.ps1` into the file that opens up and save it.
